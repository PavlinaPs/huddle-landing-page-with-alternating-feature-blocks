## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- BEM

### What I learned

This layout is a compilation of two layouts I made before this one, therefore there weren't any new issues.

### Continued development

I need to make sure to write a self-explanatory code so anybody would be able to take over when needed.
I also need to look up what is the best to code with margin and what with padding.
